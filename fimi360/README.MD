# Camera mount for FIMI X8 SE

## Description

![FIMI X8 SE with mount](images/drone.jpeg)

This project enables mounting cameras with 1/4-20 UNC and GoPro connectors to FIMI X8 SE drone. I used this awesome [mount project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3713687) from Thingverse as starting point and extended it using [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:62800) and [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:125939) libraries. Project is created using OpenSCAD so it is very easy to modify it. So feel free to open it in OpenSCAD and adjust to your needs or use pre-build components from [build](build/) folder.
